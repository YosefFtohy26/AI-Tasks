To identify Hassan’s best fit among Formula 1 teams, I compared his driving profile with Red Bull, Ferrari,
and Mercedes using four similarity measures: cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance,
and Pearson correlation. The results showed that Ferrari is the closest match, with the highest similarity 
and the smallest differences across traits. Red Bull also aligned well but slightly less than Ferrari, 
while Mercedes showed the weakest fit, including a negative correlation. Based on this analysis, 
Ferrari is the strongest recommendation for Hassan, with Red Bull as a close alternative.
